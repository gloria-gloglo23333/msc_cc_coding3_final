### For this final project, I chose to use machine learning to generate music. I used a model called Melody RNN, a recurrent neural network developed by Google in magenta, as my main generative model. Using it as a model allows the machine to learn more accurately and generate music more smoothly. What I did was not to use MelodyRNN's pre-trained model for direct generation. Instead, I chose to train the model myself.

To this (start with #C:

And this (using the previous midi file as a start melody:

### I found that the generated sounds all have strong randomness. The music generated with the pre-music clips had more of the style and melody of the pre-music clips. This led me to think that if the pre-music snippets were also put through a machine learning process, would the resulting sounds be more varied?


### So I found another LSTM based model called MAGNet LSTM model to re-generated the sound clips and make it as guide of my generated melody.

#### I didn't change too much of this code and only changed a few that make it looks like more accuracte

    loss_type : "mse" -> "msle"
    
    number_rnn_layers : 2 ->  3
    
    rnn_number_units : 64 ->  128
    
    opt : Adam -> Adamax
    
But it makes every epoch become slower and uncleared:(


#### So I only changed those two:

    rnn_number_units : 64 ->  128
    
    opt : Adam -> Adamax
    
    
#### The loss become smaller

    Epoch 300/300
    18/18 [==============================] - 8s 421ms/step - loss: 0.0659
    
    
    Epoch 300/300
    13/13 [==============================] - 10s 805ms/step - loss: 0.0364

Really bad right? :(


### Finally, I used pre-trained song clip as staring clip!

Become a little better :( but is also awful :(



#### Also, I try to make some clips by using the midi files as based note and add different sound effect:
