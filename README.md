For this final project, I chose to use machine learning to generate music. I used a model called Melody RNN, a recurrent neural network developed by Google in magenta, as my main generative model. Using it as a model allows the machine to learn more accurately and generate music more smoothly. What I did was not to use MelodyRNN's pre-trained model for direct generation. Instead, I chose to train the model myself.
